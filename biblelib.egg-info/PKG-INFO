        ========================
        
        This repository provides utilities for working with data about 
        
        * Bible books and groupings
        * a "standard" set of pericope definitions
        * Bible references
        
        This does *not* include any actual Bible texts: for that purpose, see
        the [Biblia.com API](http://bibliaapi.com/docs/) developed by
        [Faithlife](https://faithlife.com/about). There is a simple Biblia
        client in Python in the `biblia` package.
        
        
        ## To Do
        
        - Tests via ``$ setup.py test`` (if it's concise).
        
        Pull requests are encouraged!
        
        ## Limitations
        
        This supports the conventions of the [Logos Bible
        Datatype](https://wiki.logos.com/bible_datatypes), but much of this
        functionality should be useful for other purposes as well. Note that
        only a small number of the most common Bible datatypes are supported,
        and full support is never likely to be added (we have much existing C#
        code in the app to handle that).
